### objectdetect.frontalcatface.js ###

A frontal cat face detector using the basic set of Haar features, i.e.
horizontal and vertical features but not diagonal features.

 KNOWN LIMITATIONS:

 Sometimes, the detector mistakenly thinks that a human face is a cat face. In
 situations where either a human or a cat might be encountered, use both a
 human face detector and a cat face detector. Then, if a detected human face
 and a detected cat face intersect, reject the cat face.

 An upright subject is assumed. In situations where the cat's face might be
 sideways or upside down (e.g. the cat is rolling over), try various rotations
 of the input image.

### objectdetect.handopen.js ###

"Because many people have asked for it, I believe that it will make your life easier I give you my trained hand HAAR cascade xml file.
It's trained on about 20k positives and 20k negatives and works on any orientation.
Watch for high false positive rates. It also works with the cuda version of OpenCV.
It will help you but it won't make you happy."
